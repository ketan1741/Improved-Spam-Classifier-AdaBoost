# Improvised-Spam-Classifier
## About

* A Spam Classfier was built using Naive Bayes to classify spam in this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection). 
* In this repo, I will expand on the previous analysis by using a few of the new techniques that will improvise the classification model and help achieve a better model.
